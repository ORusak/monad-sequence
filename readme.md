# Introduction
```bash
$ npm install monad-sequence-promise
```

# Why
* Abstracting and hiding sequence execution mechanisms;
* Control executive sequence;
* Control calls service functions: defined, arguments, returning value;
* Transfer the extended number of parameters between service functions;
* Mixin additional functionality without changing the service functions, keeping them clean;
* Debugging execution sequence through logging.

# Usage Patterns
* Sequence sequence shares by *operation*. Operation group calculation which result need next operation.
* Operation shares by *action*. Action - service function usually pure.

Example usage, temporal, look unit test.
